status_rule:

Provider Foundation completed. Task 018 Provider Foundation Governance Cleanup
aligned documentation, dependency governance, schema-version policy, and
validation with the completed foundation before starting the next subsystem.

Process Readiness has started. Process Readiness contracts completed through
Task 019. ProcessRuntime local provider completed through Task 020.
ProcessRuntime boundary gate completed through Task 021.

Git workflow governance completed through Task 022. It establishes the default
main-first task flow, branch approval requirement, and commit/push discipline for
future Marvex tasks.

Task 023 audit completed. It found README/status drift after Process Readiness
and Git workflow governance work.

Task 024 is the current governance cleanup. It aligns README.md,
PROJECT_STATUS.md, and project-status validation with the post-Task-022 state.

Task 026 is the current governance planning slice. It documents future
localhost-only HTTP endpoint contracts for health/version responses without
implementing HTTP runtime behavior, service mode, daemon behavior, subprocess
runtime, CLI integration, Core integration, or dependency additions.

next_allowed_work_after_task_026:

Only a small approved task slice after an approved task plan. The likely next
candidate is a CLI health/version command plan, but it is not authorized for
implementation yet.
